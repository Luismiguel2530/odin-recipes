# odin-recipes

This is a project of a recipe website. I hope to demonstrate what I am learning about HTML and make the necessary changes when needed. Skills: Good Syntaxis and proper tags and elements.  

# working-on-recipe structure with html

Multiple pages (.html) were added to the main index.html with information regarding recipe structures. 

# working-on-recipe styling with CSS

I have added style to every file on the Odin-recipes project as instructed. I have used the knowledge acquired on this course plus outside references and documentations.
